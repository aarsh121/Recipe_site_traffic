Tasty Bytes 🍜 Recipe Site Web Traffic
This project was my final practical exam for my Data Scientist Professional certification with Python and SQL at DataCamp.


Synopsis 📋
Tasty Bytes is a start-up company founded in 2020 amid the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. The company's inception was motivated by the global yearning for cooking inspiration.

Initially, Tasty Bytes was conceived as a recipe search engine that assisted individuals in identifying culinary solutions for the limited provisions available at their homes.

After more than two years of business operations, Tasty Bytes has evolved into a fully-fledged enterprise. The company operates on a subscription-based model offering two monthly subscription plans: basic and premium.


Objective 🎯
Daily, Tasty Bytes features selected cooking recipes on the its homepage. The company's product team analysis indicates that the most popular recipes generate additional traffic to the rest of the website — up to 40%. Consequently, the increase in web traffic leads to more subscriptions to the Tasty Bytes' services.

The positive relationship between recipe popularity, web traffic, customer engagement and services subscriptions motivated the company to apply data science and machine learning for its operational and strategic marketing.

The Tasty Bytes' product team has the following requests regarding recipe discovery:

Predict which recipes will lead to high web traffic.
Correctly predict high-traffic recipes 80% of the time.

Data 🗃️
The dataset is provided as a CSV file and it can be found in the /datasets directory of this repository. The file contains a sample dataset of the recipe site traffic.


Method ⚙️
The initial insights are obtained through the application of exploratory and statistical data analysis.

This project requires the development of a supervised prediction machine learning (ML) model for binary classification.

The ML model development workflow includes:

Data validation and modification
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
Data preprocessing (data standardization)
Feature engineering (one-hot encoding)
Input-feature selection
Basic ML model development
Comparison ML model development
ML model optimization
ML model evaluation
Business metric definition
Summary and recommendations
